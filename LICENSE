# Quantum Shapeshifting Morphogenetic

When I published my book about the climate change I wanted it to be free: https://genesis.re/book

> **"Information always wants to be free"**

At this moment in time (Friday 22nd Sept 2023) we do not now for sure which one is the most appriopriate: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses

That's why "Quantum Shapeshifting Morphogenetic" for the time being.

Philosophically we are the closest to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL

But it is ironic that WTFPL itself is copyrighted? See discussion: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/149050/should-i-change-the-name-of-the-wtfpl
